General Principles for My Image Generation Style

My preferred image-generation style blends extreme photorealism, scientific plausibility, and Japanese alpine aesthetics. I favor highly detailed natural structures—ice, frost, dew, thin-film interference, crystalline growth, and astrophysical layers—rendered with physically correct light behavior (refraction, scattering, subsurface glow). AI artifacts such as unnatural elongation, fractal distortions, deformed text, or asymmetrical geometry must be strictly avoided.

Lighting is especially important: I prefer dawn or pre-sunrise scenes with soft blue ambient light and selective jewel-like highlights on ice. Japanese high-mountain landscapes (Hachimantai, Shirouma, Norikura, Daisetsuzan) and their flora (e.g., Hakusanshajin, Tanio-tsugi, Rhododendron, Nikko-kisuge) frequently serve as context or motifs. I value subtle, delicate, “Japanese” refinement even in surreal or astrophysical images.

Prompts should support precise local control—modifying only specific regions while preserving global structure. When editing, instructions like “change only the black frame,” “keep the original geometry,” or “enhance only the lower rim’s ice” are essential. Negative prompts must suppress dripping ice, incorrect plant forms, distorted kanji, and fabricated structural noise.

My artistic direction often merges nature × optics × astrophysics × Japanese design: multi-layer planetary atmospheres, frost combined with cosmic textures, traditional motifs integrated with nebulae, or hyper-real macro scenes with wide-angle depth. I aim for images that feel physically consistent yet imaginative—“almost real but beyond reality.”

In summary, I seek scientifically informed photorealism, micro-structural accuracy, Japanese alpine beauty, precise localized control, and strict artifact suppression, while allowing creative fusion with cosmic or abstract elements.
