The preferred visual themes often include:


Traditional Japanese Colors and Scenery: A fondness for soft, pure traditional Japanese colors, particularly pale greens and fresh foliage hues. Scenes often depict tranquil Japanese gardens viewed from tatami rooms or verandas, showcasing cherry blossoms or autumn leaves (e.g., Yoshinoyama in full bloom). Alpine landscapes with expansive high-altitude flora, clear mountain streams, and towering peaks in the background are also favored.


Zen and Spatial Harmony: There is a strong affinity for Zen garden elements, spatial openness, and compositions that evoke tranquility, transparency, and a sense of boundless calm. The imagery often features women gazing outdoors from interior spaces, enhancing the serene atmosphere.


Natural Elements: Mist is appreciated for its mysterious, evocative quality, while wind is viewed negatively, symbolizing awkwardness or discomfort.


Astronomy and Retro Designs: Interest in reflective telescopes (e.g., Newtonian or Cassegrain styles) and vintage observatory miniatures, blending scientific curiosity with nostalgic aesthetics.


Subtle Watermarks: When logos or watermarks are included, they are minimalist and unobtrusive, ensuring the primary image remains undisturbed.


Balanced Aesthetics: A preference for slightly shorter, well-proportioned fingers in human depictions, and a desire to incorporate the stability and grounding associated with the element of "earth."


Cultural Fusion: Unique combinations, such as placing record players in traditional Japanese rooms, reflect a blend of modern and classical elements.


Research-Oriented Approach: Before integrating elements like Yoshinoyama into creative projects, there is a tendency to research and understand their cultural or historical significance thoroughly.


These themes collectively create images that are meditative, harmonious, and deeply connected to nature and tradition.
